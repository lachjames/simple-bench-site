Agatha makes a stack of 5 cold, fresh single-slice ham sandwiches (with no sauces or condiments) in Room A, then immediately uses duct tape to stick the top surface of the uppermost sandwich to the bottom of her walking stick. She then walks to Room B, with her walking stick, so how many whole sandwiches are there now, in each room?
A. 4 whole sandwiches in room A, 0 whole sandwiches in Room B
B. no sandwiches anywhere
C. 4 whole sandwiches in room B, 1 whole sandwich in Room A
D. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room B
E. 4 whole sandwiches in Room B, 1 whole sandwiches in room A
F. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room A


Model Response:
Let me think about this step by step:

1) Initially, there are 5 sandwiches stacked in Room A.

2) Agatha tapes the TOP of the uppermost sandwich to her walking stick.
   - This means the sandwich is attached in a way that doesn't destroy it
   - The sandwich remains whole and intact

3) When she walks to Room B:
   - She takes her walking stick with her
   - The uppermost sandwich is attached to the stick
   - The other 4 sandwiches are NOT attached to anything
   - They remain in Room A

4) After she moves:
   - 1 whole sandwich is now in Room B (attached to stick)
   - 4 whole sandwiches remain in Room A
   - No sandwiches were broken or destroyed in this process

5) The question asks for WHOLE sandwiches:
   - Room A: 4 whole sandwiches
   - Room B: 1 whole sandwich

Final Answer: A
