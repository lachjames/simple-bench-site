Model Response:
Let me solve this step by step:

1. Initial setup:
- Green apple, red pear, and pink peach on shelf
- Yellow banana under pink peach
- Purple plum on top of pink peach
- Three students with matching colored scarves

2. What happens:
- Red-scarfed boy eats red pear
- Green-scarfed boy eats:
  * green apple
  * three other fruits
  * (total of 4 fruits)

3. Count remaining fruits:
- Started with 5 fruits total
- Red-scarfed boy ate 1
- Green-scarfed boy ate 4
- Therefore, no fruits remain

4. Logic about pink-scarfed boy:
- All fruits have been eaten by the other two students
- There are no fruits left for the pink-scarfed boy to eat
