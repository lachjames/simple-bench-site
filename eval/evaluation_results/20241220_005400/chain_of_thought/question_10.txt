Question ID: 10
Prompt:
You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
A luxury sports-car is traveling north at 30km/h over a roadbridge, 250m long, which runs over a river that is flowing at 5km/h eastward. The wind is blowing at 1km/h westward, slow enough not to bother the pedestrians snapping photos of the car from both sides of the roadbridge as the car passes. A glove was stored in the trunk of the car, but slips out of a hole and drops out when the car is half-way over the bridge. Assume the car continues in the same direction at the same speed, and the wind and river continue to move as stated. 1 hour later, the water-proof glove is (relative to the center of the bridge) approximately
A. 4km eastward
B. <1 km northward
C. >30km away north-westerly
D. 30 km northward
E. >30 km away north-easterly.
F. 5 km+ eastward


Model Response:
Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what forces are acting on the glove:
   * The glove inherits the car's northward velocity of 30km/h initially
   * The river moves eastward at 5km/h
   * The wind blows westward at 1km/h

2) When the glove falls:
   * It will quickly lose its northward momentum due to air resistance
   * It will fall into the river
   * Once in the river, the wind effect will be negligible as the glove is in water

3) After falling in the river:
   * The glove will primarily move with the river current
   * The river moves eastward at 5km/h
   * The initial northward momentum will be lost quickly

4) After 1 hour:
   * The main movement will be due to the river current
   * Distance moved eastward = 5km/h Ã— 1h = 5km

5) Other considerations:
   * The initial northward momentum is lost quickly
   * The wind effect is minimal once in water
   * The glove will be carried by the river current eastward

6) Therefore, after 1 hour, the glove will be approximately 5km eastward from the center of the bridge, possibly slightly more due to initial conditions.
