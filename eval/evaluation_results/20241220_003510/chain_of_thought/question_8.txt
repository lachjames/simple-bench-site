Model Response:
Let me solve this step by step:

1. Initial setup:
- Green apple, red pear, and pink peach on shelf
- Yellow banana under pink peach
- Purple plum on top of pink peach
- Three students with matching colored scarves

2. What we know about the eating:
- Red-scarfed boy eats the red pear
- Green-scarfed boy eats the green apple and three other fruits (total 4 fruits)

3. Let's count the total fruits:
- Green apple
- Red pear
- Pink peach
- Yellow banana
- Purple plum
Total: 5 fruits

4. Analyze what's left:
- Red-scarfed boy: 1 fruit (red pear)
- Green-scarfed boy: 4 fruits (green apple + 3 others)
- That's 5 fruits total
- No fruits remain for the pink-scarfed boy

5. Therefore, since all fruits are accounted for between the red-scarfed and green-scarfed boys, the pink-scarfed boy cannot eat any fruits.
