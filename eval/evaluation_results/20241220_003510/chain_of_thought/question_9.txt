Agatha makes a stack of 5 cold, fresh single-slice ham sandwiches (with no sauces or condiments) in Room A, then immediately uses duct tape to stick the top surface of the uppermost sandwich to the bottom of her walking stick. She then walks to Room B, with her walking stick, so how many whole sandwiches are there now, in each room?
A. 4 whole sandwiches in room A, 0 whole sandwiches in Room B
B. no sandwiches anywhere
C. 4 whole sandwiches in room B, 1 whole sandwich in Room A
D. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room B
E. 4 whole sandwiches in Room B, 1 whole sandwiches in room A
F. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room A


Model Response:
Let me think about this step by step:

1) Initially, there are 5 sandwiches stacked in Room A.

2) Agatha tapes the TOP of the uppermost sandwich to her walking stick.
   - This means the sandwich is attached but still intact
   - No sauce/condiments means less likely to fall apart

3) When she walks with the stick to Room B:
   - The stack of 4 sandwiches stays in Room A
   - The 1 sandwich attached to the stick moves with her to Room B
   - Being attached on top means gravity won't make it fall off
   - Cold, fresh sandwiches are more stable/firm
   - No sauces means less slippery

4) After she reaches Room B:
   - 4 sandwiches remain in Room A
   - 1 sandwich (still whole) is in Room B with her

5) The question specifically asks about WHOLE sandwiches
   - Since there's no mention of damage or breaking
   - All sandwiches should still be whole

Final Answer: C
