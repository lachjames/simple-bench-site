First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Beth puts 4 ice cubes in at start of minute 1\n   * Beth puts 5 ice cubes in at start of minute 2\n   * Beth puts some unknown number (let's call it x) at start of minute 3\n   * No ice cubes in minute 4\n   * The average over these 4 minutes is 5 ice cubes\n\n2. Let's write an equation:\n   * (4 + 5 + x + 0) \u00f7 4 = 5\n   * 9 + x = 20\n   * x = 11\n\n3. So we know:\n   * Minute 1: 4 ice cubes\n   * Minute 2: 5 ice cubes\n   * Minute 3: 11 ice cubes\n   * Minute 4: 0 ice cubes\n\n4. However, the question asks how many ice cubes are in the pan at the end of minute 3.\n\n5. Since this is a frying pan that's cooking a crispy egg:\n   * The temperature would be very hot (well above 100\u00b0C/212\u00b0F)\n   * Ice cubes would melt almost immediately\n   * Water from melted ice would evaporate quickly\n\n6. Therefore, by the end of minute 3, all ice cubes would have melted and evaporated.\n\nFinal Answer: B\n\nThe answer must be 0 because all ice cubes would have melted and evaporated in the hot frying pan. While 20 total ice cubes were added over the period, none would remain in solid form by the end of the third minute due to the high temperature required for frying an egg.",
