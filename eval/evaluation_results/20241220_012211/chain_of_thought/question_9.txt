Agatha makes a stack of 5 cold, fresh single-slice ham sandwiches (with no sauces or condiments) in Room A, then immediately uses duct tape to stick the top surface of the uppermost sandwich to the bottom of her walking stick. She then walks to Room B, with her walking stick, so how many whole sandwiches are there now, in each room?
A. 4 whole sandwiches in room A, 0 whole sandwiches in Room B
B. no sandwiches anywhere
C. 4 whole sandwiches in room B, 1 whole sandwich in Room A
D. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room B
E. 4 whole sandwiches in Room B, 1 whole sandwiches in room A
F. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room A


Model Response:
Let me think about this step by step:

1) Initially, Agatha makes 5 sandwiches in Room A.

2) She then tapes the top surface of the uppermost sandwich to her walking stick.

3) When she does this, all 5 sandwiches are still connected because:
   - The sandwiches are cold and fresh
   - There are no sauces or condiments that might make them slip
   - Just plain ham sandwiches would tend to stick together a bit naturally
   - The top one being taped to the stick would lift the others due to slight adhesion between slices

4) When she walks to Room B with her walking stick:
   - The walking stick has the sandwiches attached to it
   - All 5 sandwiches would move together to Room B
   - There would be no reason for any sandwiches to remain in Room A

5) Therefore, after moving to Room B:
   - Room B now has all 5 whole sandwiches
   - Room A has 0 sandwiches

Final Answer: D
