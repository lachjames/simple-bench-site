Question ID: 10
Prompt:
You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
A luxury sports-car is traveling north at 30km/h over a roadbridge, 250m long, which runs over a river that is flowing at 5km/h eastward. The wind is blowing at 1km/h westward, slow enough not to bother the pedestrians snapping photos of the car from both sides of the roadbridge as the car passes. A glove was stored in the trunk of the car, but slips out of a hole and drops out when the car is half-way over the bridge. Assume the car continues in the same direction at the same speed, and the wind and river continue to move as stated. 1 hour later, the water-proof glove is (relative to the center of the bridge) approximately
A. 4km eastward
B. <1 km northward
C. >30km away north-westerly
D. 30 km northward
E. >30 km away north-easterly.
F. 5 km+ eastward


Model Response:
Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what forces are acting on the glove:
   * The river's flow (5km/h eastward)
   * The wind (1km/h westward)
   * Initial forward momentum from the car (30km/h northward)

2) When the glove falls:
   * It will hit the water with some northward momentum
   * This momentum will quickly dissipate in the water
   * The wind effect on a wet glove in water will be minimal

3) After the glove hits the water:
   * The dominant force will be the river current
   * The glove will primarily move eastward at 5km/h
   * Other forces will become negligible

4) After 1 hour:
   * The glove will have moved approximately 5km eastward with the river
   * The westward wind (1km/h) will have minimal effect on a waterlogged glove
   * The initial northward momentum will be lost shortly after impact

5) Therefore, after 1 hour, the glove will be approximately 5km east of where it fell.
