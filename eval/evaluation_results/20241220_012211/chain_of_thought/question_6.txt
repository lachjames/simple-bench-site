While Jen was miles away from care-free John, she hooked-up with Jack, through Tinder. John has been on a boat with no internet access for weeks, and Jen is the first to call upon ex-partner Johnâ€™s return, relaying news (with certainty and seriousness) of her drastic Keto diet, bouncy new dog, a fast-approaching global nuclear war, and, last but not least, her steamy escapades with Jack. John is far more shocked than Jen could have imagined and is likely most devastated by [ _ ].
A. wider international events
B. the lack of internet
C. the dog without prior agreement
D. sea sickness
E. the drastic diet
F. the escapades


Model Response:
Let me think through this step by step:

1. First, let's consider John's perspective:
- He's been isolated at sea
- He's returning to shocking news from an ex-partner
- Multiple pieces of news are delivered

2. Let's analyze each piece of news:
- Keto diet: Personal change but doesn't affect John directly
- New dog: Affects Jen's life but not John's
- Nuclear war: Globally significant but impersonal
- Escapades with Jack: Directly personal and emotional

3. Important context:
- Jen is an "ex-partner"
- They're still close enough that she's first to call
- There may be lingering feelings

4. Psychology:
- People tend to be most affected by things that impact them personally and emotionally
- Romantic/sexual relationships carry strong emotional weight
- Other news items are either impersonal or trivial in comparison

5. The phrasing "more shocked than Jen could have imagined" suggests:
- Jen underestimated the emotional impact
- The impact relates to something she thought was less significant
- Of all items, she likely thought the nuclear war would be most shocking

6. Most devastating news would be:
- Something personal
- Something that affects existing feelings
- Something that changes their relationship dynamic

The escapades with Jack would be most devastating because it's the most personally and emotionally impactful, especially given their apparent continued connection.
