Prompt:
You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?
A. 30
B. 0
C. 20
D. 10
E. 11
F. 5


Model Response:
SOCRATES: My dear philosophers, we gather today to unravel a puzzle involving ice cubes, time, and mathematical reasoning. Let us examine this question about Beth's curious experiment. First, shall we establish what we know?

ARISTOTLE: Let us categorize the known facts systematically:
- First minute: 4 ice cubes
- Second minute: 5 ice cubes
- Third minute: Unknown quantity
- Fourth minute: 0 ice cubes
- Average of 5 ice cubes per minute

PLATO: But surely, Aristotle, we must first contemplate the perfect form of an average. Is not an average the ideal representation of central tendency?

DIOGENES: *throws a melting ice cube* Bah! Why are we placing ice cubes in a hot frying pan? Has everyone lost their minds? The real question should be why Beth isn't using water like a normal person!

SOCRATES: Let us stay focused. How might we determine the unknown quantity in the third minute?

ARISTOTLE: We can use mathematical reasoning. If the average is 5 cubes per minute over 4 minutes, then:
(4 + 5 + x + 0) ÷ 4 = 5
Where x is the number of cubes added in minute 3

EPICURUS: Yes, this brings us pleasure - the pleasure of solving! Let us multiply both sides by 4:
4 + 5 + x + 0 = 20

PLATO: Then x must be 11, as 4 + 5 + 11 + 0 = 20

DIOGENES: *laughing* But you fools forget! The question asks how many ice cubes remain at the end of the third minute. They're in a HOT FRYING PAN!

EPICURUS: Ah, Diogenes makes a valid point about practical outcomes. A frying pan is typically around 350°F/175°C.

ARISTOTLE: Indeed. Ice melts at 32°F/0°C. The laws of thermodynamics dictate that...

PLATO: The perfect form of ice cannot exist in such heat!

DIOGENES: *mockingly* Finally, you all see the obvious! Beth has created a puddle, not an ice cube collection!

SOCRATES: Let us confirm our reasoning:
1. The total ice cubes added were 4 + 5 + 11 = 20
2. However, they were placed in a hot frying pan
3. Ice melts rapidly at high temperatures
4. A frying pan hot enough to cook a "crispy egg" would melt ice instantly

EPICURUS: The practical outcome is clear - all ice would melt almost immediately.

PLATO: Though the mathematical form suggests 20, the physical reality demands otherwise.

SOCRATES: After our lengthy discourse, we must now render judgment. Based on our philosophical examination, I conclude that all ice cubes would have melted by the end of the third minute.

DIOGENES: *splashing the melted water at everyone* Here's your perfect form of ice now!

Final Answer: B

Expected Answer: B
Model Answer: B
Correct: True
