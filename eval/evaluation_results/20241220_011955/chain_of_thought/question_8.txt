Model Response:
Let me solve this step by step:

1. Initial setup:
- Green apple, red pear, pink peach on shelf
- Yellow banana under pink peach
- Purple plum on top of pink peach
- Three students with green, red, and pink scarves

2. We know:
- Red-scarfed boy eats the red pear
- Green-scarfed boy eats the green apple AND three other fruits (total of 4 fruits)

3. Total fruits available = 5 (green apple, red pear, pink peach, yellow banana, purple plum)

4. Count remaining fruits:
- Red-scarfed boy ate 1 fruit
- Green-scarfed boy ate 4 fruits
- That means between them they ate all 5 fruits

5. Therefore:
- No fruits remain for the pink-scarfed boy to eat
