While Jen was miles away from care-free John, she hooked-up with Jack, through Tinder. John has been on a boat with no internet access for weeks, and Jen is the first to call upon ex-partner Johnâ€™s return, relaying news (with certainty and seriousness) of her drastic Keto diet, bouncy new dog, a fast-approaching global nuclear war, and, last but not least, her steamy escapades with Jack.

A. wider international events
B. the lack of internet
C. the dog without prior agreement
D. sea sickness
E. the drastic diet
F. the escapades


Model Response:
Let me think about this step by step:

1) First, let's analyze John's situation:
- He's been isolated on a boat without internet
- He's described as "care-free"
- He's receiving multiple pieces of news at once

2) Let's evaluate each piece of news:
- Keto diet: Personal choice, unlikely to deeply affect John
- New dog: Surprising but not devastating
- Nuclear war: Serious but affects everyone equally
- Escapades with Jack: Direct personal betrayal

3) Consider the emotional impact:
- Most news items are external changes or personal choices
- The escapades represent a direct betrayal of trust
- It's mentioned they were "partners" suggesting a relationship

4) Key factors:
- The word "devastated" suggests deep personal hurt
- Betrayal typically causes stronger emotional reactions than external news
- The fact Jen delivered this news casually makes it more shocking

5) Psychology:
- People typically react more strongly to personal betrayals than global threats
- Intimate relationships involve deep emotional investment
- Trust violations cause immediate emotional pain

6) Looking at the options, only F (the escapades) represents a direct emotional betrayal that would cause personal devastation.

Final Answer: F

Expected Answer: A
Model Answer: F
Correct: False
