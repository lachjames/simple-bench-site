Question ID: 10
Prompt:
You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
A luxury sports-car is traveling north at 30km/h over a roadbridge, 250m long, which runs over a river that is flowing at 5km/h eastward. The wind is blowing at 1km/h westward, slow enough not to bother the pedestrians snapping photos of the car from both sides of the roadbridge as the car passes. A glove was stored in the trunk of the car, but slips out of a hole and drops out when the car is half-way over the bridge. Assume the car continues in the same direction at the same speed, and the wind and river continue to move as stated. 1 hour later, the water-proof glove is (relative to the center of the bridge) approximately
A. 4km eastward
B. <1 km northward
C. >30km away north-westerly
D. 30 km northward
E. >30 km away north-easterly.
F. 5 km+ eastward


Model Response:
Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what forces affect the glove:
   - Initial northward momentum from the car (30km/h)
   - River flow eastward (5km/h)
   - Wind westward (1km/h)

2) After the glove falls:
   - The northward momentum will quickly dissipate once it hits the water
   - The glove will then primarily be carried by the river current
   - The wind's effect (1km/h westward) is minimal compared to the river flow (5km/h eastward)

3) One hour later:
   - The northward distance will be negligible as water resistance stops this motion
   - The westward wind (1km/h) will partially counteract the eastward river flow (5km/h)
   - Net eastward movement will be approximately 4km/h (5km/h - 1km/h)
   - After one hour, this means roughly 4km eastward movement

4) Looking at the options:
   - The glove won't be 30km north or >30km in any direction as it loses its northward momentum
   - It won't be <1km north as it's carried by the river
   - 5km+ eastward would be too far given the wind resistance
   - 4km eastward matches our calculation
