Agatha makes a stack of 5 cold, fresh single-slice ham sandwiches (with no sauces or condiments) in Room A, then immediately uses duct tape to stick the top surface of the uppermost sandwich to the bottom of her walking stick. She then walks to Room B, with her walking stick, so how many whole sandwiches are there now, in each room?
A. 4 whole sandwiches in room A, 0 whole sandwiches in Room B
B. no sandwiches anywhere
C. 4 whole sandwiches in room B, 1 whole sandwich in Room A
D. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room B
E. 4 whole sandwiches in Room B, 1 whole sandwiches in room A
F. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room A


Model Response:
Let me think about this step by step:

1) Initially, 5 sandwiches are made in Room A

2) The top sandwich is duct taped to the walking stick
- This keeps the sandwich intact as it's just attached from one surface
- Cold sandwiches without sauce are relatively stable

3) Agatha walks to Room B with the walking stick
- The walking stick has 1 sandwich attached
- Therefore that 1 sandwich moves to Room B
- The movement shouldn't destroy the sandwich as it's cold and has no slippery ingredients

4) The remaining 4 sandwiches stay in Room A where they were made

5) Final count:
- Room A: 4 whole sandwiches (the ones left behind)
- Room B: 1 whole sandwich (the one attached to walking stick)

Final Answer: A

Expected Answer: A
