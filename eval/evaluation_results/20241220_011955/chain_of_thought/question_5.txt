Model Response:
Let me think about this step by step:

1. The situation is a life-or-death emergency requiring immediate action (CPR)

2. Paul and Peter are best friends, suggesting a strong current relationship
   - Despite past conflicts, they maintained their friendship
   - Being best friends implies they've moved past childhood issues

3. The Pokemon collection argument was from childhood
   - This is a relatively minor incident from long ago
   - Most people outgrow and forgive childhood disputes

4. The text exchange exists in the cloud
   - While potentially embarrassing, this is far less important than saving a life
   - No reasonable person would prioritize old texts over a friend's life

5. Basic human instinct and moral obligation
   - Most people will help in life-threatening situations regardless of past conflicts
   - The instinct to save a life typically overrides other concerns
   - There could be legal implications for not helping

6. Paul being the only person around creates a clear moral and practical imperative
   - No option to defer responsibility to others
   - Direct consequence of inaction would be death of best friend

Considering all factors, particularly that they're best friends and this is a life-or-death situation, old childhood drama would be irrelevant in the moment.
