Question ID: 10
Prompt:
You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
A luxury sports-car is traveling north at 30km/h over a roadbridge, 250m long, which runs over a river that is flowing at 5km/h eastward. The wind is blowing at 1km/h westward, slow enough not to bother the pedestrians snapping photos of the car from both sides of the roadbridge as the car passes. A glove was stored in the trunk of the car, but slips out of a hole and drops out when the car is half-way over the bridge. Assume the car continues in the same direction at the same speed, and the wind and river continue to move as stated. 1 hour later, the water-proof glove is (relative to the center of the bridge) approximately
A. 4km eastward
B. <1 km northward
C. >30km away north-westerly
D. 30 km northward
E. >30 km away north-easterly.
F. 5 km+ eastward


Model Response:
The key here is to break down the movements of the car and the glove separately, then consider them relative to the center of the bridge.

1.  **Car's Movement:** The car travels at 30 km/h north. It passes the halfway point of the 250m bridge, and the glove drops. The car continues for another hour at 30km/h. The bridge length is irrelevant to calculating the car's final location after 1 hour.

2.  **Glove's Initial Movement:** The glove is initially moving at the same speed and direction as the car (30 km/h north), but this is only until it falls out of the trunk. Once the glove drops, the car's velocity no longer impacts its movement.

3.  **Glove's Movement After Falling:**
    *   **River:** The river flows eastward at 5 km/h. This is the primary force acting on the glove after it falls into the river.
    *   **Wind:** The wind blows westward at 1 km/h, so it partially counteracts the river current.
    *   **Net Eastward Velocity:** The glove's net eastward speed is 5 km/h (river) - 1 km/h (wind) = 4 km/h.
    *   **Northward Velocity:** Once it falls into the river, the glove no longer has any velocity northward (the car's forward motion is now irrelevant).

4. **Glove's Position After 1 Hour:**
    *  **Eastward Distance:** In one hour, the glove will be 4 km eastward (4 km/h * 1 hour).
    *   **Northward Distance:** Since it fell into the river, the glove has no northward velocity. It will have drifted *slightly* downstream due to the initial momentum, but relative to the distance it has travelled eastward, this will be negligible.

5. **Relative to Bridge Center:** The glove is 4km eastward of the point where it dropped, which is at the center of the bridge. Therefore, relative to the center of the bridge, the glove is approximately 4 km eastward.
