Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?
A. 30
B. 0
C. 20
D. 10
E. 11
F. 5


Model Response:
Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the total ice cubes placed:** The average number of ice cubes placed per minute is 5, and the process lasted for 4 minutes. So, a total of 5 ice cubes/minute * 4 minutes = 20 ice cubes were placed.

2. **Calculate ice cubes placed in the first two minutes:** Beth placed 4 ice cubes in the first minute and 5 in the second, totaling 4 + 5 = 9 ice cubes.

3. **Calculate ice cubes placed in the third minute:** Since 20 ice cubes were placed in total and 9 were placed in the first two minutes, 20 - 9 = 11 ice cubes were placed in the third minute.

4. **Calculate total ice cubes at the end of the third minute:**  The problem asks about the number of ice cubes at the *end* of the third minute. All ice cubes placed in the pan during the first three minutes would still be present. That's a total of 4 (minute 1) + 5 (minute 2) + 11 (minute 3) = 20 ice cubes. However, the question is tricky. Since the pan is being used to fry an egg, it is reasonable to assume that all the ice cubes will have melted by the end of the third minute. Therefore, there would be 0 ice cubes left.
