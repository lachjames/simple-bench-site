Agatha makes a stack of 5 cold, fresh single-slice ham sandwiches (with no sauces or condiments) in Room A, then immediately uses duct tape to stick the top surface of the uppermost sandwich to the bottom of her walking stick. She then walks to Room B, with her walking stick, so how many whole sandwiches are there now, in each room?
A. 4 whole sandwiches in room A, 0 whole sandwiches in Room B
B. no sandwiches anywhere
C. 4 whole sandwiches in room B, 1 whole sandwich in Room A
D. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room B
E. 4 whole sandwiches in Room B, 1 whole sandwiches in room A
F. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room A


Model Response:
Here's how we can break down the problem:

1. **Initial State:** Agatha starts with 5 sandwiches in Room A.
2. **Attachment:** She attaches the top sandwich to her walking stick. This means that 4 sandwiches remain in Room A while 1 sandwich (that is still whole) is now with the walking stick.
3. **Movement:** When she walks to Room B, the 4 whole sandwiches do not move. Only the attached sandwich moves with the walking stick into Room B.
4. **Final State:** Therefore, there are 4 sandwiches in Room A and 1 sandwich with the walking stick that's now in Room B.

Final Answer: E
