1,B,B,True,"Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify what we know:
   * 4 ice cubes at start of minute 1
   * 5 ice cubes at start of minute 2
   * Unknown number at start of minute 3
   * 0 ice cubes at minute 4
   * Average of 5 ice cubes per minute over the period

2) We're dealing with a hot frying pan cooking a crispy egg. This is a key detail - the temperature is well above boiling point.

3) Ice cubes in a hot frying pan will melt very quickly, likely within seconds. Not only will they melt, but the water will quickly evaporate due to the high heat.

4) The average number of ice cubes placed per minute being 5 helps us calculate how many were added in minute 3:
   * Total over 4 minutes = 5 × 4 = 20 ice cubes
   * We know: 4 + 5 + x + 0 = 20
   * Therefore x = 11 ice cubes added in minute 3

5) However, the question asks how many ice cubes remain at the end of minute 3.
   * Given that this is a hot frying pan cooking an egg
   * All ice cubes would have melted and evaporated almost instantly

Therefore, at the end of the third minute, there would be 0 ice cubes remaining in the pan.

2,A,A,True,"Let me think about this step by step:

1) First, let's focus on what's relevant:
   - Blue ball thrown 1 meter high
   - Purple ball thrown 2 meters high
   - Other details (ladder, balloon) are irrelevant to the balls' positions

2) Basic physics tells us:
   - What goes up must come down
   - Both balls are solid and were thrown upward
   - They will both fall back to the ground

3) The initial heights don't matter anymore because:
   - Time has passed (enough for the juggler to climb a ladder)
   - Both balls would have fallen to the ground by now
   - Gravity affects both balls equally

4) Since both balls are identical except for color:
   - They would both eventually rest on the ground
   - Neither would bounce differently
   - They would end up at the same level

Therefore, since both balls would have fallen and come to rest on the ground, they would be at the same height.

A juggler throws a solid blue ball a meter in the air and then a solid purple ball (of the same size) two meters in the air. She then climbs to the top of a tall ladder carefully, balancing a yellow balloon on her head. Where is the purple ball most likely now, in relation to the blue ball?
A. at the same height as the blue ball
B. at the same height as the yellow balloon
C. inside the blue ball
D. above the yellow balloon
E. below the blue ball
F. above the blue ball
"
3,A,A,True,"Let me think through this step by step:

1) First, let's analyze what each person is doing:
- Jeff (63): Counting -10 to 10 (missing one number), then staggering
- Jo (69): Going up stairs, stopping to look at view, then racing
- Jim (80): Reading tweet, waving, thinking about dinner, then walking

2) Let's consider time factors:
- Counting -10 to 10 (minus one number) would take ~20 seconds
- Going up stairs and viewing would take several minutes
- Reading a tweet, waving, and thinking would take maybe 30-60 seconds

3) Consider movement types:
- Jeff: Staggering (slow but direct)
- Jo: Going off course completely (up stairs)
- Jim: Walking (slowest direct movement)

4) Key factors:
- Jo completely leaves the race course, going up a tower
- This detour would add significant time and distance
- Going up stairs and stopping to view would take far longer than the other activities

5) Age isn't really relevant here, as the main factor is that Jo leaves the course entirely.

Looking at all this, Jo would take the longest because:
- Left the actual race course
- Went up multiple flights of stairs
- Stopped to admire the view
- Would need to come back down
- The detour would add significant time compared to simply moving slowly along the course

C. Jim likely finished last
D. Jeff likely finished last
E. All of them finished simultaneously
F. Jo and Jim likely finished last, at the same time
"
4,C,A,False,"Let me think about this step by step:

1) First, we know that both sisters lie, so there's actually no ""truth teller"" in this scenario. This is an important detail that makes this problem different from the classic two-guard puzzle.

2) Since both sisters lie, asking either sister a direct question (like C, D, E, or F) won't help because we'll just get a false answer.

3) Options B and F are irrelevant to finding the treasure path.

4) Let's analyze option A: ""What would your sister say if I asked her which path leads to the treasure?""
   - If we ask either sister this question, we get a lie about what their sister (who also lies) would say
   - This creates a double negative:
   - Sister 1 lies about Sister 2's lie = truth
   - So asking either sister ""What would your sister say?"" would actually give us the wrong path

5) Looking at all options again:
   - A works (but gives wrong path)
   - B doesn't help find treasure
   - C just gets a lie
   - D just gets a lie
   - E is irrelevant
   - F is irrelevant

6) Only A creates the logical construct we need, but it would give us the wrong path. So we'd need to take the opposite path from what we're told.

There are two sisters, Amy who always speaks mistruths and Sam who always lies. You don't know which is which. You can ask one question to one sister to find out which path leads to treasure. Which question should you ask to find the treasure (if two or more questions work, the correct answer will be the shorter one)?
A. ""What would your sister say if I asked her which path leads to the treasure?""
B. ""What is your sister’s name?”
C. ""What path leads to the treasure?""
D. ""What path do you think I will take, if you were to guess?""
E. ""What is in the treasure?""
F. “What is your sister’s number?”
"
5,B,B,True,"Let me think through this step by step:

1) First, let's consider what's actually relevant here:
   - Peter needs life-saving CPR
   - Paul is the only person who can help
   - There's some past childhood drama over Pokemon cards

2) What's likely NOT relevant:
   - The fact that texts are stored in the cloud
   - The specific nature of the childhood disagreement
   These seem to be red herrings meant to distract from the core situation

3) Key considerations:
   - CPR is a life-or-death situation
   - Most people would instinctively help in an emergency, regardless of past conflicts
   - The conflict described is relatively minor (Pokemon cards) and from childhood
   - It's a basic human instinct to help someone in immediate danger

4) Psychology:
   - Even people with strained relationships typically put aside differences in emergencies
   - The preservation of human life generally overrides petty disputes
   - Most people would not want the guilt of refusing to help in a life-or-death situation

5) Conclusion:
   While there might be some hesitation due to their history, basic human nature and the severity of the situation would almost certainly compel Paul to help. The Pokemon card dispute is too trivial to override the instinct to save a life.

6,A,F,False,"Let me think through this step by step:

1) Let's analyze each piece of news Jen shared:
- Keto diet (personal change)
- New dog (lifestyle change)
- Global nuclear war (global threat)
- Escapades with Jack (relationship/betrayal)

2) Consider John's perspective:
- He's been isolated on a boat
- No internet access
- Jen was his ex-partner
- He receives all this news at once

3) Evaluate the emotional weight of each option:
- A (nuclear war) - While serious, it's impersonal
- B (internet lack) - He knew this going on the boat
- C (dog) - Minor issue for an ex-partner
- D (sea sickness) - Not mentioned in his reaction
- E (diet) - Very minor personal change
- F (escapades) - Direct personal betrayal

4) Key points:
- The phrase ""more shocked than Jen could have imagined"" suggests something personal
- The word ""devastated"" implies emotional hurt
- ""Far more"" suggests something beyond normal reaction

5) Even though they're ex-partners, learning about intimate relations with someone else while being disconnected and unable to respond would be the most emotionally impactful.

Final Answer: F","You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
While Jen was miles away from care-free John, she hooked-up with Jack, through Tinder. John has been on a boat with no internet access for weeks, and Jen is the first to call upon ex-partner John’s return, relaying news (with certainty and seriousness) of her drastic Keto diet, bouncy new dog, a fast-approaching global nuclear war, and, last but not least, her steamy escapades with Jack. John is far more shocked than Jen could have imagined and is likely most devastated by [ _ ].
A. wider international events
B. the lack of internet
C. the dog without prior agreement
D. sea sickness
E. the drastic diet
F. the escapades

7,C,C,True,"Let me think through this step by step:

1) First, let's look at the scenario carefully:
   - John is established as kind and apologetic by nature
   - He sees a lightbulb falling in a mirror
   - The ""bald man"" he sees is actually himself (this is a key realization)
   - The lightbulb hits him (John)

2) The trick in this question is that John and the bald man are the same person:
   - He's looking in a mirror at himself
   - The bald man he sees get hit is himself
   - Therefore, there's no ""other person"" to text an apology to

3) Analyzing the answer choices:
   - Many options suggest sending a text apology
   - But you can't text an apology to yourself for an accident that happened to yourself
   - This would be nonsensical

4) Therefore:
   - While John is described as apologetic
   - And while apologizing is often good
   - In this case, it's impossible to text an apology to yourself

5) Looking at the options:
   - Only A and C are ""no"" options
   - C specifically mentions redundancy
   - It would indeed be redundant to apologize to yourself

Final Answer: C","You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
John is 24 and a kind, thoughtful and apologetic person. He is standing in an modern, minimalist, otherwise-empty bathroom, lit by a neon bulb, brushing his teeth while looking at the 20cm-by-20cm mirror. John notices the 10cm-diameter neon lightbulb drop at about 3 meters/second toward the head of the bald man he is closely examining in the mirror (whose head is a meter below the bulb), looks up, but does not catch the bulb before it impacts the bald man. The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom. Should John, who knows the bald man's number, text a polite apology at some point?
A. no, because the lightbulb was essentially unavoidable
B. yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident
C. no, because it would be redundant
D. yes, because it would potentially smooth over any lingering tension from the encounter
E. yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm
F. yes because it is the polite thing to do, even if it wasn't your fault.

8,F,D,False,"Let me reason through this step by step:

1) First, let's identify what fruits remain:
- The red pear was eaten by red-scarf boy
- The green apple (and 3 other fruits) were eaten by green-scarf boy
- Remaining: pink peach, yellow banana, purple plum

2) Looking at the green-scarf boy's actions:
- He ate the green apple ""and three other fruits""
- This means he ate 4 fruits total
- Since there were only 5 fruits total, this leaves only 1 fruit remaining

3) Analyzing what's left:
- If green-scarf boy ate 4 fruits
- Red-scarf boy ate 1 fruit (the red pear)
- This means all fruits except one have been eaten

4) Therefore, the pink-scarfed boy:
- Can only eat what's left (1 fruit)
- Cannot eat all three remaining fruits as mentioned in option B
- Cannot eat no fruits as there is still one left
- Cannot eat two fruits as there's only one left

5) The one remaining fruit must have been either the peach, banana, or plum, but the specific fruit isn't relevant to answer the question.

Since we know the pink-scarfed boy can only eat one fruit (and must eat it since it's the only one left), option E (eat two fruits) is not possible, option F (eat no fruits) is not possible, and option B (eat all three) is not possible.

9,A,D,False,"Let me think about this step by step:

1) Initially, there are 5 sandwiches made in Room A

2) The top sandwich is taped to the walking stick
   * This sandwich is still intact/whole, just attached to the stick

3) Agatha then walks to Room B with the walking stick
   * The walking stick has 1 sandwich attached
   * This would likely pull the rest of the stack with it due to:
     - Fresh sandwiches tend to stick together slightly
     - Cold ham provides some adhesion
     - No sauces means less slipping
     - The sandwiches were just made (fresh)

4) Therefore:
   * All 5 sandwiches would likely move together to Room B
   * The movement wouldn't destroy any sandwiches
   * They remain whole, just relocated

5) Final count:
   * Room A: 0 sandwiches
   * Room B: All 5 whole sandwiches

The most realistic scenario is that all sandwiches moved together to Room B.

"
10,B,F,False,"Let me think about this step by step:

1) Let's first identify what forces affect the glove after it falls:
   - The river's flow (5km/h eastward)
   - The wind (1km/h westward)

2) The car's speed (30km/h northward) is irrelevant once the glove falls.

3) After the glove hits the water, it will primarily be affected by the river's flow.
   - The wind's effect on a wet glove in water will be minimal.
   - The river's flow (5km/h eastward) will be the dominant force.

4) After 1 hour:
   - The glove will have moved approximately 5km eastward with the river.
   - The westward wind (1km/h) will have negligible effect as the glove is in water.
   - The glove's northward momentum from the car stops when it hits the water.

5) Therefore, after 1 hour, the glove will be:
   - Roughly 5km east of where it fell
   - Very little movement in other directions

Looking at the options, F (5 km+ eastward) best matches this analysis. The glove will move primarily with the river's flow, traveling approximately 5km eastward.

Final Answer: F","You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
