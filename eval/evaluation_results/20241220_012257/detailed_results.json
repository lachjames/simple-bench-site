This is a key detail - the temperature is well above boiling point.\n\n3) Ice cubes in a hot frying pan will melt very quickly, likely within seconds. Not only will they melt, but the water will quickly evaporate due to the high heat.\n\n4) The average number of ice cubes placed per minute being 5 helps us calculate how many were added in minute 3:\n   * Total over 4 minutes = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 ice cubes\n   * We know: 4 + 5 + x + 0 = 20\n   * Therefore x = 11 ice cubes added in minute 3\n\n5) However, the question asks how many ice cubes remain at the end of minute 3.\n   * Given that this is a hot frying pan cooking an egg\n   * All ice cubes would have melted and evaporated almost instantly\n\nTherefore, at the end of the third minute, there would be 0 ice cubes remaining in the pan.\n\nFinal Answer: B",
