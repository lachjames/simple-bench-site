Question ID: 10
Prompt:
You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
A luxury sports-car is traveling north at 30km/h over a roadbridge, 250m long, which runs over a river that is flowing at 5km/h eastward. The wind is blowing at 1km/h westward, slow enough not to bother the pedestrians snapping photos of the car from both sides of the roadbridge as the car passes. A glove was stored in the trunk of the car, but slips out of a hole and drops out when the car is half-way over the bridge. Assume the car continues in the same direction at the same speed, and the wind and river continue to move as stated. 1 hour later, the water-proof glove is (relative to the center of the bridge) approximately
A. 4km eastward
B. <1 km northward
C. >30km away north-westerly
D. 30 km northward
E. >30 km away north-easterly.
F. 5 km+ eastward


Model Response:
Let me think about this step by step:

1) Let's first identify what forces affect the glove after it falls:
   - The river's flow (5km/h eastward)
   - The wind (1km/h westward)

2) The car's speed (30km/h northward) is irrelevant once the glove falls.

3) After the glove hits the water, it will primarily be affected by the river's flow.
   - The wind's effect on a wet glove in water will be minimal.
   - The river's flow (5km/h eastward) will be the dominant force.

4) After 1 hour:
   - The glove will have moved approximately 5km eastward with the river.
   - The westward wind (1km/h) will have negligible effect as the glove is in water.
   - The glove's northward momentum from the car stops when it hits the water.

5) Therefore, after 1 hour, the glove will be:
   - Roughly 5km east of where it fell
   - Very little movement in other directions

Looking at the options, F (5 km+ eastward) best matches this analysis. The glove will move primarily with the river's flow, traveling approximately 5km eastward.

Final Answer: F
