Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?
A. 30
B. 0
C. 20
D. 10
E. 11
F. 5


Model Response:
SOCRATES: Noble philosophers, we gather today to examine a peculiar question involving ice cubes, time, and arithmetic. Let us begin by considering what we know about these ice cubes in a frying pan. First, let us establish the given facts.

ARISTOTLE: The facts appear straightforward:
- First minute: 4 ice cubes
- Second minute: 5 ice cubes
- Third minute: Unknown number
- Fourth minute: 0 ice cubes
- Average of 5 ice cubes per minute

DIOGENES: *Laughs while holding a melting ice cube* Why are we even discussing ice cubes in a frying pan? Has anyone here ever tried to keep ice frozen in a hot pan? This is absurd!

PLATO: The physical nature of ice and heat is not our primary concern, Diogenes. We seek the ideal form of this mathematical problem.

DIOGENES: *Throws an ice cube at Plato* And why do we assume these "whole" ice cubes remain whole in a hot pan? The very premise is laughable!

EPICURUS: Perhaps we should consider the practical aspects. A frying pan is indeed hot enough to cook an egg, which requires approximately 150°F...

DIOGENES: *Interrupts* And you're telling me ice cubes would survive even a second in such heat? Nonsense!

SOCRATES: Let us focus on the mathematical relationship first. What can we deduce about the average?

ARISTOTLE: If the average is 5 ice cubes per minute over 4 minutes, then the total number of ice cubes must be 20.

DIOGENES: But when do we start counting? When the ice becomes water? When it becomes steam? This is madness!

PLATO: The ideal form of this problem suggests we should focus on the initial placement of ice cubes, not their eventual state.

EPICURUS: Yes, let's calculate: 4 + 5 + x + 0 = 20 (where x is the number of ice cubes added in the third minute)

DIOGENES: *Sarcastically* Oh, so now we're pretending that ice doesn't melt? Next you'll tell me that fire is cold!

SOCRATES: What can we determine about x?

ARISTOTLE: If 4 + 5 + x + 0 = 20, then x must be 11.

PLATO: So in the third minute, 11 ice cubes were added.

DIOGENES: *Rolling on the floor laughing* And you expect these 20 ice cubes to just sit there in a hot pan? Have you all lost your minds?

EPICURUS: The question specifically asks about the end of the third minute...

DIOGENES: Exactly! By which time they would all be water! Or steam! Or perhaps they've transcended to a higher plane of existence!

PLATO: But we must consider the abstract nature of the problem...

DIOGENES: *Pours water on Plato* There's your abstract ice cube!

ARISTOTLE: Let us count systematically: first minute 4, second minute 5, third minute 11. Therefore, the total placed is 20.

EPICURUS: But the question asks specifically about what remains at the end of the third minute.

PLATO: Surely we must consider...

DIOGENES: *Interrupts again* Has anyone here ever cooked an egg? Have you seen what happens to ice in a hot pan? This is the most absurd thought experiment I've ever heard!

SOCRATES: Let us consider the physical reality of the situation.

ARISTOTLE: A frying pan hot enough to cook a "crispy egg" would be well above the melting point of ice.

EPICURUS: Indeed, ice melts at 0°C, while egg cooking requires at least 65°C.

DIOGENES: Finally! Some sense! Though I still think you're all mad for even entertaining this discussion.

PLATO: But the mathematical truth...

DIOGENES: *Throws another ice cube* Mathematics won't keep your ice from melting!

SOCRATES: After our lengthy discourse, we must now render judgment. Based on our philosophical examination, I conclude that while 20 ice cubes were placed in total, and the third minute addition was 11 cubes, the physical reality of a hot frying pan means that by the end of the third minute, all ice cubes would have melted.
