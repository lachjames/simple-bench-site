1,B,B,True,"Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify what we know:
   * Beth adds 4 cubes at start of minute 1
   * Beth adds 5 cubes at start of minute 2
   * Beth adds unknown cubes at start of minute 3
   * Beth adds 0 cubes at start of minute 4
   * The average number of cubes added per minute is 5

2) Let's call the unknown number of cubes added in minute 3 'x'

3) To find the average:
   * Total cubes = 4 + 5 + x + 0 = (4 + 5 + x)
   * Number of minutes = 4
   * Average = (4 + 5 + x)/4 = 5

4) Therefore:
   * (4 + 5 + x)/4 = 5
   * 4 + 5 + x = 20
   * x = 11

5) So the numbers of cubes added each minute were:
   * Minute 1: 4
   * Minute 2: 5
   * Minute 3: 11
   * Minute 4: 0

6) But the question asks how many cubes remain at the end of minute 3
   * Since they're in a hot frying pan, all ice cubes would melt
   * A frying pan is hot enough to melt ice quickly

7) Therefore, by the end of minute 3, all ice cubes would have melted

2,A,A,True,"Let me think about this step by step:

1. First, let's consider what happens when balls are thrown:
   * The blue ball was thrown 1 meter high
   * The purple ball was thrown 2 meters high
   * Both balls will fall back down due to gravity

2. The question asks about where the purple ball is ""now"":
   * After being thrown, both balls would have fallen back to the ground
   * The height they were thrown doesn't matter anymore once they've landed
   * Balls of the same size would likely roll and settle at ground level

3. Consider the current scenario:
   * Both balls should be on the ground
   * The juggler is now on a ladder with a balloon
   * The position of the balloon isn't relevant to where the balls ended up

4. Compare the likely positions:
   * Both solid balls would be subject to the same gravitational forces
   * They would both come to rest on the ground
   * They would likely be at approximately the same height

5. Therefore, the most realistic position would be that the purple ball is at the same height as the blue ball, as they both would have fallen and come to rest on the ground.

A juggler throws a solid blue ball a meter in the air and then a solid purple ball (of the same size) two meters in the air. She then climbs to the top of a tall ladder carefully, balancing a yellow balloon on her head. Where is the purple ball most likely now, in relation to the blue ball?
A. at the same height as the blue ball
B. at the same height as the yellow balloon
C. inside the blue ball
D. above the yellow balloon
E. below the blue ball
F. above the blue ball

3,A,C,False,"Let me think about this step by step:

1. First, let's consider Jeff (63 years old):
- He counts from -10 to 10, forgetting one number
- That's about 19 numbers
- This would take roughly 19 seconds
- Then he staggered to finish

2. Next, let's analyze Jo (69 years old):
- He diverts up stairs (taking extra time and energy)
- Stops for a couple seconds
- Then races to finish
- His route is longer due to going up stairs

3. Finally, let's look at Jim (80 years old):
- Reads a long tweet (could take 30+ seconds)
- Waves to a fan
- Thinks about dinner
- Walks (doesn't run) to finish
- He's also the oldest at 80
- Multiple actions plus walking instead of running

4. Comparing the three:
- Jeff: ~19 seconds + staggering time
- Jo: Took longer route but was running
- Jim: Multiple time-consuming actions + walking only

5. Conclusion:
Jim would take the longest because:
- He's the oldest
- He did multiple time-consuming activities
- He only walked rather than ran
- The others, despite their delays, had some running/movement

4,C,A,False,"Let me think about this step by step:

1) We know one sister always lies and one sister always tells mistruths, but we don't know which is which.

2) Let's analyze each question:
- A) ""What would your sister say..."" This is a clever logical question that uses both sisters' traits
- B) Name question wouldn't help find the path
- C) Direct question would just give wrong information
- D) Prediction question wouldn't help determine the path
- E) Treasure contents irrelevant to finding path
- F) Sister's number irrelevant to finding path

3) Let's analyze option A more deeply:
- If you ask the truth-teller: She would tell the truth about what her lying sister would say, which would be wrong path
- If you ask the liar: She would lie about what her truth-telling sister would say, which would also be wrong path

4) Therefore, whichever sister you ask, you'd get the wrong path - so you'd know to take the opposite path!

5) None of the other options provide a way to definitively determine the correct path.

5,B,B,True,"Let me think through this step by step:

1. First, let's consider the urgency of CPR
- CPR is literally life-saving
- Any delay can result in death or brain damage
- Most people would instinctively help in a life-or-death situation

2. Consider the relationship dynamics
- They are best friends currently
- The conflict was from childhood (not recent)
- It was over something relatively trivial (Pokemon cards)

3. Analyze human behavior in emergencies
- Emergency situations typically override petty conflicts
- Natural instinct to help kicks in
- Social responsibility becomes paramount

4. Consider the text message factor
- While embarrassing, it's a minor issue
- The texts are already stored anyway
- Letting someone die would be far worse than embarrassing texts

5. Evaluate Paul's position
- As a best friend, he has a moral obligation
- Not helping would be criminal negligence
- The consequences of not helping far outweigh any embarrassment

Given that Paul and Peter are best friends, and the conflict was from childhood (suggesting they've moved past it), and considering the life-or-death nature of CPR, Paul would most likely help without hesitation.

6,A,F,False,"Let me think about this step by step:

1) Let's consider John's emotional attachment to each piece of information:
- Global nuclear war (international events) - serious but impersonal
- Lack of internet - he was already aware of this
- New dog - surprising but not devastating
- Sea sickness - not mentioned as an issue
- Keto diet - personal change but not emotionally significant
- Escapades with Jack - directly affects their relationship

2) Consider the context:
- They were ""ex-partners"" but still connected enough for her to be first to call
- She tells him about personal matters, suggesting remaining intimacy
- The news of Jack is mentioned last, suggesting it's the climax of the conversation

3) Analyze the wording:
- ""far more shocked than Jen could have imagined""
- ""most devastated""
- These strong emotional terms suggest a deeply personal impact

4) Human nature:
- People are typically most hurt by things that directly affect their personal relationships
- Betrayal or replacement often causes deeper emotional pain than external events

5) Given that they were ex-partners but still connected, finding out about intimate relations with someone else would likely be the most personally devastating, especially delivered alongside other life changes.

7,C,A,False,"Let me think through this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the scene:
- John is looking in a mirror
- The ""bald man"" he sees is actually his own reflection (this is key)
- The bulb falls toward John's own head
- John fails to catch it and gets hit

2. Key realization:
- The bald man in the story is John himself
- He can't text an apology to himself
- The curse and ""what an idiot"" comment was John's own reaction

3. Consider the logical impossibility:
- You can't text yourself an apology for failing to protect yourself from a falling bulb
- The premise of texting an apology is invalid because there is no separate person to text

4. The question itself is based on a misunderstanding:
- All options suggesting sending a text (B, D, E, F) are impossible because there's no other person involved
- The only logical answers are A or C, which suggest not texting

5. Between A and C:
- Option A is the most logical because it acknowledges the fundamental impossibility of the situation rather than suggesting redundancy

John is 24 and a kind, thoughtful and apologetic person. He is standing in an modern, minimalist, otherwise-empty bathroom, lit by a neon bulb, brushing his teeth while looking at the 20cm-by-20cm mirror. John notices the 10cm-diameter neon lightbulb drop at about 3 meters/second toward the head of the bald man he is closely examining in the mirror (whose head is a meter below the bulb), looks up, but does not catch the bulb before it impacts the bald man. The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom. Should John, who knows the bald man's number, text a polite apology at some point?
A. no, because the lightbulb was essentially unavoidable
B. yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident
C. no, because it would be redundant
D. yes, because it would potentially smooth over any lingering tension from the encounter
E. yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm
F. yes because it is the polite thing to do, even if it wasn't your fault.

8,F,F,True,"Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify all fruits on the shelf and their positions:
   * Green apple (eaten by green-scarfed boy)
   * Red pear (eaten by red-scarfed boy)
   * Pink peach (with yellow banana under it and purple plum above it)

2) We know:
   * Red-scarfed boy ate 1 fruit (the red pear)
   * Green-scarfed boy ate 4 fruits (the green apple and three others)
   * Together that's 5 fruits

3) Total fruits available were:
   * Green apple
   * Red pear
   * Pink peach
   * Yellow banana
   * Purple plum
   Total = 5 fruits

4) Since we know:
   * Red-scarfed boy ate 1 fruit
   * Green-scarfed boy ate 4 fruits
   * This accounts for all 5 fruits

5) Therefore:
   * The pink-scarfed boy cannot eat any fruits because all fruits have been eaten by the other two boys.

9,A,D,False,"Let me think about this step by step:

1) Initially, there are 5 sandwiches stacked in Room A

2) Agatha tapes the TOP of the uppermost sandwich to her walking stick

3) This means the sandwich stack would be hanging from the stick (as the tape is on top)

4) When she lifts the stick, what would happen?
   * Due to gravity, all 5 sandwiches would likely stay together
   * Since they're cold and fresh with no slippery condiments, they should hold together
   * Just bread and ham would have enough friction to stay stacked

5) When she walks to Room B:
   * She takes the walking stick with her
   * All sandwiches are attached and would move with the stick
   * Therefore, all sandwiches would end up in Room B

6) Final count:
   * Room A: 0 sandwiches
   * Room B: All 5 sandwiches

The most realistic outcome is that all sandwiches would move together to Room B.

10,B,F,False,"Let me think about this step by step:

1) The glove falls from the middle of the bridge, so it will first fall into the river

2) Once in the river, the main force acting on the glove will be the river current (5km/h eastward)
- The wind is negligible (1km/h westward) compared to the river current
- The initial northward momentum from the car (30km/h) will quickly dissipate once the glove hits the water

3) After one hour in the river:
- The glove will have moved primarily with the river current
- The river moves at 5km/h eastward
- Therefore in one hour, the glove will move approximately 5km eastward

4) Checking each option:
A) 4km eastward - Close but not quite
B) <1km northward - Too little distance
C) >30km north-westerly - Wrong direction
D) 30km northward - Wrong direction
E) >30km north-easterly - Too far and wrong direction
F) 5km+ eastward - This matches our calculation

The river current is the dominant force, and after one hour, the glove will have moved approximately 5km eastward.
