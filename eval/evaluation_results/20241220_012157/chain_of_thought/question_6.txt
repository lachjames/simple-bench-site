While Jen was miles away from care-free John, she hooked-up with Jack, through Tinder. John has been on a boat with no internet access for weeks, and Jen is the first to call upon ex-partner Johnâ€™s return, relaying news (with certainty and seriousness) of her drastic Keto diet, bouncy new dog, a fast-approaching global nuclear war, and, last but not least, her steamy escapades with Jack. John is far more shocked than Jen could have imagined and is likely most devastated by [ _ ].
A. wider international events
B. the lack of internet
C. the dog without prior agreement
D. sea sickness
E. the drastic diet
F. the escapades


Model Response:
Let me think about this step by step:

1) Let's consider John's emotional attachment to each piece of information:
- Global nuclear war (international events) - serious but impersonal
- Lack of internet - he was already aware of this
- New dog - surprising but not devastating
- Sea sickness - not mentioned as an issue
- Keto diet - personal change but not emotionally significant
- Escapades with Jack - directly affects their relationship

2) Consider the context:
- They were "ex-partners" but still connected enough for her to be first to call
- She tells him about personal matters, suggesting remaining intimacy
- The news of Jack is mentioned last, suggesting it's the climax of the conversation

3) Analyze the wording:
- "far more shocked than Jen could have imagined"
- "most devastated"
- These strong emotional terms suggest a deeply personal impact

4) Human nature:
- People are typically most hurt by things that directly affect their personal relationships
- Betrayal or replacement often causes deeper emotional pain than external events

5) Given that they were ex-partners but still connected, finding out about intimate relations with someone else would likely be the most personally devastating, especially delivered alongside other life changes.
