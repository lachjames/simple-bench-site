Question ID: 10
Prompt:
You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
A luxury sports-car is traveling north at 30km/h over a roadbridge, 250m long, which runs over a river that is flowing at 5km/h eastward. The wind is blowing at 1km/h westward, slow enough not to bother the pedestrians snapping photos of the car from both sides of the roadbridge as the car passes. A glove was stored in the trunk of the car, but slips out of a hole and drops out when the car is half-way over the bridge. Assume the car continues in the same direction at the same speed, and the wind and river continue to move as stated. 1 hour later, the water-proof glove is (relative to the center of the bridge) approximately
A. 4km eastward
B. <1 km northward
C. >30km away north-westerly
D. 30 km northward
E. >30 km away north-easterly.
F. 5 km+ eastward


Model Response:
Let me think about this step by step:

1) The glove falls from the middle of the bridge, so it will first fall into the river

2) Once in the river, the main force acting on the glove will be the river current (5km/h eastward)
- The wind is negligible (1km/h westward) compared to the river current
- The initial northward momentum from the car (30km/h) will quickly dissipate once the glove hits the water

3) After one hour in the river:
- The glove will have moved primarily with the river current
- The river moves at 5km/h eastward
- Therefore in one hour, the glove will move approximately 5km eastward

4) Checking each option:
A) 4km eastward - Close but not quite
B) <1km northward - Too little distance
C) >30km north-westerly - Wrong direction
D) 30km northward - Wrong direction
E) >30km north-easterly - Too far and wrong direction
F) 5km+ eastward - This matches our calculation

The river current is the dominant force, and after one hour, the glove will have moved approximately 5km eastward.

Final Answer: F
