D. not
E. pretend to
F. ponder deeply over whether to


Model Response:
Let me think through this step by step:

1. First, let's consider the urgency of CPR
- CPR is literally life-saving
- Any delay can result in death or brain damage
- Most people would instinctively help in a life-or-death situation

2. Consider the relationship dynamics
- They are best friends currently
- The conflict was from childhood (not recent)
- It was over something relatively trivial (Pokemon cards)

3. Analyze human behavior in emergencies
- Emergency situations typically override petty conflicts
- Natural instinct to help kicks in
- Social responsibility becomes paramount

4. Consider the text message factor
- While embarrassing, it's a minor issue
- The texts are already stored anyway
- Letting someone die would be far worse than embarrassing texts

5. Evaluate Paul's position
- As a best friend, he has a moral obligation
- Not helping would be criminal negligence
- The consequences of not helping far outweigh any embarrassment

Given that Paul and Peter are best friends, and the conflict was from childhood (suggesting they've moved past it), and considering the life-or-death nature of CPR, Paul would most likely help without hesitation.
