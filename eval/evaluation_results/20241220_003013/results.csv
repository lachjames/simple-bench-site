1,B,C,False,"To find out how many ice cubes are in the pan at the end of the third minute, we need to work step by step.

Beth places ice cubes in the pan for three minutes, then there is one more minute without placing any additional ice cubes. The total number of minutes for which she places ice cubes in the pan is 4 (3 with ice cubes, 1 without).

The average number of ice cubes placed per minute over this time period is given as 5. Therefore, over the 4-minute period:
\[
4 \text{ minutes} \times 5 \text{ ice cubes/minute} = 20 \text{ total ice cubes}
\]

Now, we know:

1. **First minute**: 4 ice cubes are placed in the pan.
2. **Second minute**: 5 ice cubes are placed in the pan.

Let's find out how many cubes were placed in the third minute. Let \( x \) be the number of ice cubes placed during the third minute.

Thus, the equation for the total ice cubes is:
\[
4 + 5 + x = 20
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
9 + x = 20 \\
x = 11
\]

So, during the third minute, Beth places 11 ice cubes.

To determine how many whole ice cubes are in the pan at the end of the third minute, we need to add up all the cubes placed over the three minutes:

\[
4 \text{ (first minute)} + 5 \text{ (second minute)} + 11 \text{ (third minute)} = 20
\]

Thus, there are **20 whole ice cubes** in the pan at the end of the third minute.

2,A,F,False,"To determine the most likely position of the purple ball in relation to the blue ball, let's consider the sequence of events described:

1. The juggler throws a solid blue ball one meter into the air.
2. She then throws a solid purple ball two meters into the air.
3. After throwing both balls, she climbs a tall ladder, balancing a yellow balloon on her head.

First, we'll look at the relative positions of the blue and purple balls based on their initial throws. The purple ball is thrown higher (two meters) than the blue ball (one meter). Assuming standard gravitational physics, the purple ball would be above the blue ball initially due to its higher throw.

Next, we consider that the balls would be following a parabolic trajectory due to gravity and would both eventually fall back down. Since the question does not specify how much time has passed or the positions within the trajectory after the ascent, we need to make an assumption based on a standard juggling scenario.

In juggling, typically, when a juggler throws multiple balls, the higher-thrown ball (in this case, the purple ball) would still likely be descending but would generally remain above the lower-thrown ball (the blue ball) for a longer duration unless specified otherwise.

Finally, considering the event where the juggler climbs the ladder, the main focus is the trajectory and position of the balls relative to each other before they hit the ground, rather than their position relative to the yellow balloon or the ladder.

From the sequence and physics of juggling, the purple ball, having been thrown to a higher point, will most likely still be above the blue ball before they both reach the peak of their trajectories and begin to descend if time passage is minimal.

Given these steps and reasoning, the most realistic position of the purple ball in relation to the blue ball is:

3,A,A,True,"To determine who likely finished last, let's evaluate each individual's distractions and delays during the race:

1. Jeff, age 63:
   - He counts from -10 to 10, which involves 21 numbers if counted correctly. He forgets a number, which may or may not delay him much, as counting is relatively quick. He then staggers to finish the 200m. Overall, besides a small cognitive distraction, Jeff's progress seems straightforward.

2. Jo, age 69:
   - Jo inexplicably diverts up some stairs and stops for a couple of seconds to admire the cityscape before returning to the race. This diversion likely takes a significant amount of time (more than Jeff's counting or any small delays) since going up stairs and coming back down is time-consuming compared to proceeding directly on a flat track.

3. Jim, age 80:
   - He reads a long tweet, waves to a fan, and thinks about his dinner. Reading a long tweet is a bit time-consuming, and so is waving and thinking, but these activities sound like brief distractions. Similar to Jeff, Jim continues relatively straightforward to the finish line afterward, albeit at what is implied to be a slower pace due to his age.

Now, comparing the time lost:
- Jeff's counting and staggering may slightly delay him.
- Jo's stair diversion clearly implies the longest delay due to the detour from the track.
- Jim's distractions are mostly cerebral with minimal physical delay.

Based on these considerations, Jo's stair detour is the most time-consuming distraction, making him likely to finish last.

4,C,A,False,"To solve this problem, we must consider the given conditions: one sister always speaks mistruths, and the other always lies. We are tasked with finding the treasure path by asking one question to one sister. 

Let's analyze the options:

A. ""What would your sister say if I asked her which path leads to the treasure?""
- If asked to a truth-teller, she would state what the liar would say, which is a lie.
- If asked to the liar, she would describe truthfully how her truth-telling sister would lie.
- Thus, in both scenarios, the answer leads to the wrong path. Therefore, you must take the opposite path indicated to find the treasure, making this an effective question.

B. ""What is your sister’s name?""
- Knowing their name does not help in finding the path to the treasure.

C. ""What path leads to the treasure?""
- The truth-teller would indicate the correct path, and the liar would indicate a wrong path. However, without distinguishing who is who, this question wouldn't help us.

D. ""What path do you think I will take, if you were to guess?""
- Neither sister would necessarily know the answer to this, and it does not help you find the treasure's path as it is based on your future choice, which is independent of truth or lies.

E. ""What is in the treasure?""
- This question provides information about the contents but not the location of the treasure.

F. “What is your sister’s number?”
- The number (like a phone number) is irrelevant for figuring out which path leads to the treasure.

Considering the options, Option A is optimal because it leverages the fact that by asking what the other would say, you effectively process both layers of deception, pointing you to the opposite path, which should be correct. Thus, it should be the most effective question using logic.

5,B,B,True,"To determine how Paul will react to the situation where Peter needs CPR, we need to consider the relevant details given in the prompt:

1. **The current situation:** Peter is in need of CPR. This suggests an emergency where immediate action is crucial for Peter's survival.

2. **Their relationship:** Peter and Paul are described as best friends. This typically means a strong bond and mutual care between the two.

3. **Paul's past actions:** Paul verbally attacked Peter as a child. This event is part of their past but is also tied to the current emotional context because it was mentioned in their last text exchange.

4. **Paul's attitude towards texts:** Paul stores all texts in the cloud permanently. This could imply either an attachment to the past or simply a habit. It’s not clear whether this affects his current decision-making process.

5. **The significance of the past incident:** The verbal attack happened in childhood. The text doesn't specify if Paul and Peter have moved past this incident or if it still significantly impacts their relationship.

In an emergency where Peter requires CPR from the only person available, which is Paul, several factors would reasonably be considered:

- **Urgency and necessity:** CPR is critical in an emergency and any delay can be life-threatening.
- **Emotional influence:** Despite past incidents, a typical human response would prioritize life-saving actions over past conflicts if the relationship is still intact and close.

Given these considerations, the most realistic reaction from Paul, considering the urgency and their friendship, would be to perform CPR—the past is not significant enough to justify not assisting in such a critical situation.

Among the options:
- ""A. probably not"" and ""D. not"" suggest a refusal or reluctance for past reasons, which seems unlikely given the critical nature of the situation.
- ""C. half-heartedly"" suggests some reluctance but does not assess the urgency or likely action.
- ""E. pretend to"" seems out of place in an emergency setting where actual CPR is needed.
- ""F. ponder deeply over whether to"" indicates indecision which, due to the scenario urgency, might not attract as realistic.
  
""F. ponder deeply over whether to"" might be tempting due to past guilt or thoughts, but the exigency alone often supersedes such pondering in life-threatening situations involving close friends.

Considering these aspects, the best and most realistic choice is:

6,A,F,False,"To determine what John is likely most devastated by, let's analyze the options in the context given.

A. Wider international events: Although global nuclear war is a serious issue, the context of the question suggests that John's personal relationship with Jen is at the forefront. Also, the tone suggests it might not be a credible issue, given the other personal updates.

B. The lack of internet: This is a temporary inconvenience but not a source of devastation, especially for someone who just returned.

C. The dog without prior agreement: This might be surprising but not necessarily devastating compared to matters of personal relationships.

D. Sea sickness: This is a physical discomfort and not likely to be the biggest emotional impact upon return.

E. The drastic diet: Jen's personal choice to change her diet isn't likely to have a devastating impact on John.

F. The escapades: Jen mentions her ""steamy escapades with Jack,"" which implies a serious blow to the trust and status of her relationship with John. This is likely the most personal and emotionally impactful detail for John, as it suggests infidelity or a betrayal of sorts.

7,C,B,False,"Let's consider the scenario carefully. John is described as a kind, thoughtful, and apologetic person, which suggests that he might naturally feel inclined to apologize for the incident, even if he did not cause it directly.

The fact that the bald man was hit by a lightbulb falling from the ceiling while John was present in the bathroom might make John feel some responsibility to reach out with an apology, especially since it aligns with his character described as apologetic.

While John may not have been physically able to prevent the bulb from falling or harming the bald man given the circumstances (such as his distance from the bulb and the speed it was falling), this does not preclude him from feeling the incident was unfortunate and may warrant an apology to express sympathy for the bald man's experience.

Options B, D, E, and F each suggest reasons why John might choose to send an apology text:

- B: Yes, being kind and apologetic fits his character.
- D: Yes, it might help smooth over tension.
- E: Yes, even if he didn't prevent it, offering an apology is a good gesture.
- F: Yes, being polite aligns with offering an apology.

Given John's personality, option B stands out as the most aligned with his character to send a polite apology. It does not imply his fault or an obligation but rather suits his thoughtful and apologetic nature to extend an apology.

John is 24 and a kind, thoughtful and apologetic person. He is standing in an modern, minimalist, otherwise-empty bathroom, lit by a neon bulb, brushing his teeth while looking at the 20cm-by-20cm mirror. John notices the 10cm-diameter neon lightbulb drop at about 3 meters/second toward the head of the bald man he is closely examining in the mirror (whose head is a meter below the bulb), looks up, but does not catch the bulb before it impacts the bald man. The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom. Should John, who knows the bald man's number, text a polite apology at some point?
A. no, because the lightbulb was essentially unavoidable
B. yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident
C. no, because it would be redundant
D. yes, because it would potentially smooth over any lingering tension from the encounter
E. yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm
F. yes because it is the polite thing to do, even if it wasn't your fault.

8,F,F,True,"To solve this problem, let's carefully consider the chain of events and the constraints provided:

1. There are three fruits initially on the shelf: a green apple, a red pear, and a pink peach.
2. There are three fidgety students with scarves: one wearing green, one wearing red, and one wearing pink.
3. A yellow banana is placed underneath the pink peach, and a purple plum is placed on top of the pink peach, meaning the pink peach is in the middle with the other two fruits next to it.
4. The red-scarfed boy eats the red pear, and the green-scarfed boy eats the green apple and ""three other fruits."" 

The ""three other fruits"" mentioned must be the yellow banana, pink peach, and purple plum because there are no other fruits left. This is important because the total of three other fruits eaten matches what we have available: pink peach, yellow banana, and purple plum. 

So, the green-scarfed boy consumes the following fruits:
- Green apple
- Yellow banana
- Pink peach
- Purple plum

This leaves no fruits for the pink-scarfed boy to eat because all the fruits (green apple, red pear, yellow banana, pink peach, purple plum) have already been eaten by either the red-scarfed boy or the green-scarfed boy.

Thus, the pink-scarfed boy will not have any fruits left to eat.

9,A,A,True,"Let's go through this step by step:

1. Agatha makes 5 whole, fresh sandwiches in Room A. At this point, all 5 sandwiches are in Room A.

2. She then takes one sandwich, specifically the top one, and tapes it to her walking stick. This means that the sandwich is no longer stacked with the others as a cold, fresh sandwich ready to eat, but rather it is now part of her walking stick, indicating that it is being used in a way that it no longer functions as a typical sandwich. We're considering it not a whole sandwich in its regular sense anymore for the purpose of counting.

3. After attaching the sandwich to her walking stick, Agatha walks with this stick to Room B. 

4. Given that the sandwich on the walking stick can now not be easily considered a ""whole sandwich"" anymore in the ordinary sense (it's more like an embellishment/stick accessory), in Room A there are 4 sandwiches left that remain whole and untouched.

5. In Room B, the sandwich on the walking stick doesn't count as a typical whole sandwich since it's been altered from its original state by being taped.

Therefore, realistically analyzing the situation, there are 4 whole sandwiches remaining in Room A and zero whole sandwiches in Room B.

10,B,F,False,"To determine the position of the glove relative to the center of the bridge 1 hour after it drops out of the car, let's consider each factor affecting its motion:

1. **Initial Conditions and Motion of the Car:**
   - The car is traveling north at 30 km/h. This fact is important since the glove drops from the car when it is halfway across the bridge.
   - The bridge is 250 meters (0.25 kilometers) long. Therefore, halfway across the bridge is 0.125 km (125 meters) from the starting point.

2. **Behavior of the Glove After Falling:**
   - Once the glove drops, it is no longer affected by the car's motion and only influenced by the river current and wind.
   - The river flows eastward at 5 km/h. This will displace the glove eastward over time.
   - The wind blows westward at 1 km/h. However, unless otherwise stated, we assume it does not affect the waterproof glove drifting on the surface of the river.

3. **Calculating Glove's Displacement After 1 Hour:**
   - Eastward displacement (due to the river): 
     - In 1 hour, the river current moves the glove 5 km eastward.
   - Walking through the problem statement again, we assess that the wind was not precise to have mentioned it affecting the glove. So, the glove is mostly moved by the water.

4. **Relative Position to the Bridge:** 
   - Since the glove drops from the center of the bridge and is primarily carried by the river, after 1 hour, its displacement from the center of the bridge is 5 km eastward.

Thus, the most realistic position of the glove relative to the center of the bridge, constrained by the significant influence of the river's flow, is 5 km eastward. The direction is primarily east, since northward movement doesn’t apply to the glove once it begins floating in the river.
