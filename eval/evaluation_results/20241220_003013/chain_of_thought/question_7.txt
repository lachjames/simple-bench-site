John is 24 and a kind, thoughtful and apologetic person. He is standing in an modern, minimalist, otherwise-empty bathroom, lit by a neon bulb, brushing his teeth while looking at the 20cm-by-20cm mirror. John notices the 10cm-diameter neon lightbulb drop at about 3 meters/second toward the head of the bald man he is closely examining in the mirror (whose head is a meter below the bulb), looks up, but does not catch the bulb before it impacts the bald man. The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom. Should John, who knows the bald man's number, text a polite apology at some point?
A. no, because the lightbulb was essentially unavoidable
B. yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident
C. no, because it would be redundant
D. yes, because it would potentially smooth over any lingering tension from the encounter
E. yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm
F. yes because it is the polite thing to do, even if it wasn't your fault.


Model Response:
Let's consider the scenario carefully. John is described as a kind, thoughtful, and apologetic person, which suggests that he might naturally feel inclined to apologize for the incident, even if he did not cause it directly.

The fact that the bald man was hit by a lightbulb falling from the ceiling while John was present in the bathroom might make John feel some responsibility to reach out with an apology, especially since it aligns with his character described as apologetic.

While John may not have been physically able to prevent the bulb from falling or harming the bald man given the circumstances (such as his distance from the bulb and the speed it was falling), this does not preclude him from feeling the incident was unfortunate and may warrant an apology to express sympathy for the bald man's experience.

Options B, D, E, and F each suggest reasons why John might choose to send an apology text:

- B: Yes, being kind and apologetic fits his character.
- D: Yes, it might help smooth over tension.
- E: Yes, even if he didn't prevent it, offering an apology is a good gesture.
- F: Yes, being polite aligns with offering an apology.

Given John's personality, option B stands out as the most aligned with his character to send a polite apology. It does not imply his fault or an obligation but rather suits his thoughtful and apologetic nature to extend an apology.

Final Answer: B
