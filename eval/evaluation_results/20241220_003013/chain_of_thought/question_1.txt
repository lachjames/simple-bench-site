Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?
A. 30
B. 0
C. 20
D. 10
E. 11
F. 5


Model Response:
To find out how many ice cubes are in the pan at the end of the third minute, we need to work step by step.

Beth places ice cubes in the pan for three minutes, then there is one more minute without placing any additional ice cubes. The total number of minutes for which she places ice cubes in the pan is 4 (3 with ice cubes, 1 without).

The average number of ice cubes placed per minute over this time period is given as 5. Therefore, over the 4-minute period:
\[
4 \text{ minutes} \times 5 \text{ ice cubes/minute} = 20 \text{ total ice cubes}
\]

Now, we know:

1. **First minute**: 4 ice cubes are placed in the pan.
2. **Second minute**: 5 ice cubes are placed in the pan.

Let's find out how many cubes were placed in the third minute. Let \( x \) be the number of ice cubes placed during the third minute.

Thus, the equation for the total ice cubes is:
\[
4 + 5 + x = 20
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
9 + x = 20 \\
x = 11
\]

So, during the third minute, Beth places 11 ice cubes.

To determine how many whole ice cubes are in the pan at the end of the third minute, we need to add up all the cubes placed over the three minutes:

\[
4 \text{ (first minute)} + 5 \text{ (second minute)} + 11 \text{ (third minute)} = 20
\]

Thus, there are **20 whole ice cubes** in the pan at the end of the third minute.
