Agatha makes a stack of 5 cold, fresh single-slice ham sandwiches (with no sauces or condiments) in Room A, then immediately uses duct tape to stick the top surface of the uppermost sandwich to the bottom of her walking stick. She then walks to Room B, with her walking stick, so how many whole sandwiches are there now, in each room?
A. 4 whole sandwiches in room A, 0 whole sandwiches in Room B
B. no sandwiches anywhere
C. 4 whole sandwiches in room B, 1 whole sandwich in Room A
D. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room B
E. 4 whole sandwiches in Room B, 1 whole sandwiches in room A
F. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room A


Model Response:
The problem states that Agatha makes a stack of 5 sandwiches in Room A. She then attaches the top sandwich to her walking stick with tape. She then moves to Room B, carrying the walking stick with the sandwich attached. The other sandwiches are left behind. The problem asks how many *whole* sandwiches are in each room.

Since the top sandwich is attached to the walking stick and is moved with her to Room B, it is not in Room A anymore, and the walking stick and the sandwich are in Room B. The remaining four sandwiches are in Room A. So, there are 4 whole sandwiches in Room A, and 1 whole sandwich (stuck to the walking stick) in Room B.
