Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?
A. 30
B. 0
C. 20
D. 10
E. 11
F. 5


Model Response:
Let's break this down step-by-step.
1. **Understand the problem**: We know the number of ice cubes added in the first two minutes (4 and 5 respectively) and that no ice cubes were added in the fourth minute. The overall average number of ice cubes added per minute is five. We need to find the number of ice cubes at the end of the third minute, which means we need to calculate how many ice cubes were added at the start of the third minute.
2. **Calculate total ice cubes added**: Since the average number of ice cubes per minute over the four minutes was 5, then the total number of ice cubes added in those four minutes was 5 * 4 = 20.
3. **Calculate ice cubes in the first two minutes**: We know Beth added 4 in the first minute, and 5 in the second minute, so she added a total of 4 + 5 = 9 ice cubes in the first two minutes.
4. **Calculate ice cubes in the third minute**: We know the total number of ice cubes added over 4 minutes is 20 and in the first two minutes, 9 were added so that means 20-9= 11 ice cubes were added in the 3rd and 4th minute. We also know no ice cubes were added in the 4th minute so that means 11 ice cubes were added in the third minute.
5. **Calculate the number of ice cubes by the end of the third minute**: The total number of ice cubes added at the start of the first three minutes is 4 + 5 + 11 = 20.  However, this is a trick question. Ice cubes melt! We're also told that the egg is fried 'crispy' so the pan must be hot enough for the ice cubes to melt into water, so all of the ice cubes have melted by the end of the third minute. Therefore, there are 0 ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute.
