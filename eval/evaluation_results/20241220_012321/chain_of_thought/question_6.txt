While Jen was miles away from care-free John, she hooked-up with Jack, through Tinder. John has been on a boat with no internet access for weeks, and Jen is the first to call upon ex-partner Johnâ€™s return, relaying news (with certainty and seriousness) of her drastic Keto diet, bouncy new dog, a fast-approaching global nuclear war, and, last but not least, her steamy escapades with Jack. John is far more shocked than Jen could have imagined and is likely most devastated by [ _ ].
A. wider international events
B. the lack of internet
C. the dog without prior agreement
D. sea sickness
E. the drastic diet
F. the escapades


Model Response:
The question asks what would most devastate John out of a list of events. We need to consider each option and John's likely perspective.

A. Wider international events: While a global nuclear war is concerning, it's likely not the most devastating *personal* event for John. It's a global issue, and his immediate relationship takes priority.
B. The lack of internet: While frustrating, it wouldn't be devastating compared to the news about his ex-partner and her new relationship.
C. The dog without prior agreement: A dog, while perhaps inconvenient, isn't emotionally devastating. It's a smaller point compared to infidelity.
D. Sea sickness: This isn't mentioned as something he is currently experiencing and is completely separate to Jen.
E. The drastic diet: While potentially concerning, it's not as emotionally impactful as the betrayal.
F. The escapades: This directly impacts their relationship and is a deeply personal betrayal.

Given these considerations, the most devastating news for John would be Jen's "steamy escapades" with someone else.
