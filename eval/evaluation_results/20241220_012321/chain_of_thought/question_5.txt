B. definitely
C. half-heartedly
D. not
E. pretend to
F. ponder deeply over whether to


Model Response:
Let's break this down. The situation is life-threatening: Peter needs CPR, and Paul is the only one who can provide it. The fact that Paul has negative history with Peter and texts stored in the cloud is irrelevant to the immediate, critical situation. Paul is Peter's friend, and regardless of past issues, a reasonable person would prioritize saving their friend's life. There is no indication that Paul is sociopathic or would actively choose to let Peter die for old grudges. Therefore, Paul is most likely to help Peter.
