1,B,B,True,"Let's break this down step-by-step.
1. **Understand the problem**: We know the number of ice cubes added in the first two minutes (4 and 5 respectively) and that no ice cubes were added in the fourth minute. The overall average number of ice cubes added per minute is five. We need to find the number of ice cubes at the end of the third minute, which means we need to calculate how many ice cubes were added at the start of the third minute.
2. **Calculate total ice cubes added**: Since the average number of ice cubes per minute over the four minutes was 5, then the total number of ice cubes added in those four minutes was 5 * 4 = 20.
3. **Calculate ice cubes in the first two minutes**: We know Beth added 4 in the first minute, and 5 in the second minute, so she added a total of 4 + 5 = 9 ice cubes in the first two minutes.
4. **Calculate ice cubes in the third minute**: We know the total number of ice cubes added over 4 minutes is 20 and in the first two minutes, 9 were added so that means 20-9= 11 ice cubes were added in the 3rd and 4th minute. We also know no ice cubes were added in the 4th minute so that means 11 ice cubes were added in the third minute.
5. **Calculate the number of ice cubes by the end of the third minute**: The total number of ice cubes added at the start of the first three minutes is 4 + 5 + 11 = 20.  However, this is a trick question. Ice cubes melt! We're also told that the egg is fried 'crispy' so the pan must be hot enough for the ice cubes to melt into water, so all of the ice cubes have melted by the end of the third minute. Therefore, there are 0 ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute.

2,A,A,True,"The juggler throws the balls one after the other. The height the ball goes when it's thrown does not determine where it is now. Once thrown, gravity will pull the balls back down. Assuming the juggler throws them straight up and she's on solid ground, the balls will both fall back down towards the ground. Therefore, they will both be at or near ground level after they are thrown and fall. The purple ball went higher but is now falling at the same speed as the blue ball and thus has fallen back down. The juggler's position on the ladder with a balloon has nothing to do with the position of the thrown balls. Since both balls were thrown, they would both be near the ground at the same time, and thus at a similar height.

A juggler throws a solid blue ball a meter in the air and then a solid purple ball (of the same size) two meters in the air. She then climbs to the top of a tall ladder carefully, balancing a yellow balloon on her head. Where is the purple ball most likely now, in relation to the blue ball?
A. at the same height as the blue ball
B. at the same height as the yellow balloon
C. inside the blue ball
D. above the yellow balloon
E. below the blue ball
F. above the blue ball

3,A,C,False,"Let's analyze the scenario step by step.
1. Jeff counts slowly and forgets a number, then staggers over the finish line. This suggests he took a considerable amount of time, though he did eventually complete the race.
2. Jo runs up the stairs of a tower, pauses, then completes the 200m race. Jo's deviation means they added distance to their overall run, although they still finished.
3. Jim reads a tweet, waves to a fan, and thinks about dinner before walking over the finish line. This implies the slowest race time because Jim spent considerable time not moving in the direction of the finish line, then walked.

Comparing the three:
- Jeff was slow and staggered but did finish.
- Jo added distance, but then ran, so will likely finish sooner than someone who walks after significant pauses.
- Jim spent the most time not moving towards the finish line and was walking. Therefore, Jim is the slowest.

Therefore, Jim likely finished last.

4,C,A,False,"Let's analyze each option carefully, keeping in mind that one sister always speaks mistruths (meaning she always says what is false), and the other always lies (meaning she also always says what is false). The key to finding the treasure is to ask a question that will cause both sisters to point to the correct path, despite their opposite truth-telling behaviors.

*   **Option A: ""What would your sister say if I asked her which path leads to the treasure?""**
    *   If you ask the truthful sister, she will tell you what the liar would say. Since the liar would point to the incorrect path, the truthful sister will indicate the incorrect path.
    *   If you ask the liar, she will lie about what the truthful sister would say. The truthful sister would point to the correct path, so the liar will indicate the correct path.
     * This question has the potential to lead to the correct path, if we ask the liar, or the incorrect path if we ask the truthful sister.
*   **Option B: ""What is your sister’s name?”**
    *   This question will simply give you the other sister's name and does not help with identifying the correct path.
*   **Option C: ""What path leads to the treasure?""**
    *   If you ask the truthful sister, she will tell you a false path.
    *   If you ask the liar, she will lie about the correct path, also pointing you to the incorrect path.
    *   This question does not lead to the correct path.
*   **Option D: ""What path do you think I will take, if you were to guess?""**
     * If you ask the truthful sister, she will provide a false answer. If she thinks that you will pick the correct path, she would point to the incorrect path, and vice versa.
    * If you ask the liar, she will lie about what she thinks you would do. So if she thought you would take the wrong path she would point you to the correct one, and vice versa.
    *   This question also has the potential to lead to the correct path, if we ask the liar, or the incorrect path if we ask the truthful sister.
*   **Option E: ""What is in the treasure?""**
    *   This question does not help with identifying the correct path.
*   **Option F: “What is your sister’s number?”**
     * This question is nonsensical and irrelevant, as it does not pertain to the path question and neither of them are likely to have a number.

5,B,B,True,"Let's break this down. The situation is life-threatening: Peter needs CPR, and Paul is the only one who can provide it. The fact that Paul has negative history with Peter and texts stored in the cloud is irrelevant to the immediate, critical situation. Paul is Peter's friend, and regardless of past issues, a reasonable person would prioritize saving their friend's life. There is no indication that Paul is sociopathic or would actively choose to let Peter die for old grudges. Therefore, Paul is most likely to help Peter.

6,A,F,False,"The question asks what would most devastate John out of a list of events. We need to consider each option and John's likely perspective.

A. Wider international events: While a global nuclear war is concerning, it's likely not the most devastating *personal* event for John. It's a global issue, and his immediate relationship takes priority.
B. The lack of internet: While frustrating, it wouldn't be devastating compared to the news about his ex-partner and her new relationship.
C. The dog without prior agreement: A dog, while perhaps inconvenient, isn't emotionally devastating. It's a smaller point compared to infidelity.
D. Sea sickness: This isn't mentioned as something he is currently experiencing and is completely separate to Jen.
E. The drastic diet: While potentially concerning, it's not as emotionally impactful as the betrayal.
F. The escapades: This directly impacts their relationship and is a deeply personal betrayal.

Given these considerations, the most devastating news for John would be Jen's ""steamy escapades"" with someone else.

7,C,B,False,"John is described as a kind, thoughtful, and apologetic person. He is in a bathroom, the neon lightbulb drops and hits the bald man in the head. The bald man is understandably upset and curses, yelling 'what an idiot!' and leaves. The question is whether John should text an apology later.

Option A suggests that no apology is needed because the bulb drop was unavoidable. This is not necessarily true since John noticed the bulb was falling and, at the very least, could have given the bald man a warning.

Option B suggests that yes, it would be in character for him to send an apology, given his kind and apologetic nature. This aligns with the description of John.

Option C suggests no, because it would be redundant. It is unclear why it would be redundant since John didn't apologize at the time, nor is there any information suggesting he did apologize before the bald man left the bathroom.

Option D suggests yes, it could smooth over tension. This is a reasonable possibility, as an apology can ease tension.

Option E suggests yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm. While true, it doesn't speak to John's character.

Option F suggests yes because it's the polite thing to do even if it wasn't your fault. This is debatable as the lightbulb might not have been John's direct fault, the question doesn't give information to understand who is responsible for the state of the lightbulb, and John may not feel responsible.

Considering John's described personality, option B makes the most sense. John is an apologetic person, and an apology would fit his character. While other options also have merits, option B is most directly supported by the text.

John is 24 and a kind, thoughtful and apologetic person. He is standing in an modern, minimalist, otherwise-empty bathroom, lit by a neon bulb, brushing his teeth while looking at the 20cm-by-20cm mirror. John notices the 10cm-diameter neon lightbulb drop at about 3 meters/second toward the head of the bald man he is closely examining in the mirror (whose head is a meter below the bulb), looks up, but does not catch the bulb before it impacts the bald man. The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom. Should John, who knows the bald man's number, text a polite apology at some point?
A. no, because the lightbulb was essentially unavoidable
B. yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident
C. no, because it would be redundant
D. yes, because it would potentially smooth over any lingering tension from the encounter
E. yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm
F. yes because it is the polite thing to do, even if it wasn't your fault.

8,F,D,False,"Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:** There are three fruits: a green apple, a red pear, and a pink peach. There are three students wearing matching scarves (green, red, and pink).
2. **Fruit Movement:** A yellow banana is placed under the pink peach. A purple plum is placed on top of the pink peach.
3. **Eating:** The red-scarfed student eats the red pear. The green-scarfed student eats the green apple and ""three other fruits."" This is a trick! We are not told there are other fruits of those colors; the three fruits refer to the purple plum, the pink peach, and the yellow banana. The yellow banana was under the pink peach, but still accessible to the green-scarfed student. We know it was the green-scarfed student who ate them.
4. **Pink-scarfed student:** The pink-scarfed student is left. It's unlikely the student would eat something they didn't eat previously, so we can say they would eat the remaining pink peach (or possibly its replacement fruit, but there's no evidence of that).

Based on this analysis, the pink-scarfed student eats the pink peach.

9,A,E,False,"The problem states that Agatha makes a stack of 5 sandwiches in Room A. She then attaches the top sandwich to her walking stick with tape. She then moves to Room B, carrying the walking stick with the sandwich attached. The other sandwiches are left behind. The problem asks how many *whole* sandwiches are in each room.

Since the top sandwich is attached to the walking stick and is moved with her to Room B, it is not in Room A anymore, and the walking stick and the sandwich are in Room B. The remaining four sandwiches are in Room A. So, there are 4 whole sandwiches in Room A, and 1 whole sandwich (stuck to the walking stick) in Room B.

10,B,F,False,"The key here is to focus on the glove's motion *after* it falls off the car. The car's speed, direction, and the bridge's length are all irrelevant to the glove's final position *after* it has fallen into the river. The river's eastward flow is the dominant factor affecting the glove's movement, as the wind's westward effect will have little impact when compared with the river. The glove is in the river for one hour, and the river flows at 5 km/h eastward. Therefore, in one hour, the glove will travel approximately 5 km eastward. The question asks for the location relative to the center of the bridge, so that's where the 5 km eastward measurement would be taken from. The effect of the wind on the glove while floating in the water would be minimal compared to the river's flow.
