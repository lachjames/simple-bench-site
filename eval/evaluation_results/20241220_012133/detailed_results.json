Wind effect (minimal due to wet glove in water)\n    \n    // Calculate displacement\n    river_displacement = river_speed * time\n    // river_displacement = 5 km eastward\n    \n    // The car's motion is irrelevant after the glove drops\n    // Wind effect is negligible once glove is in water\n    \n    return river_displacement\n```\n\nReasoning through execution:\n1. Once the glove falls, it quickly loses any forward momentum from the car\n2. The glove is waterproof, so it will float and be carried by the river\n3. The wind speed is very low (1km/h) and will have minimal effect on a wet glove in water\n4. The main force acting on the glove will be the river current\n5. After 1 hour, the river moving at 5km/h will carry the glove approximately 5km eastward\n6. All other forces are negligible in comparison\n\nLooking at the options, F (5 km+ eastward) most closely matches our calculated result.\n\nFinal Answer: F",

Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.\nA luxury sports-car is traveling north at 30km/h over a roadbridge, 250m long, which runs over a river that is flowing at 5km/h eastward. The wind is blowing at 1km/h westward, slow enough not to bother the pedestrians snapping photos of the car from both sides of the roadbridge as the car passes. A glove was stored in the trunk of the car, but slips out of a hole and drops out when the car is half-way over the bridge. Assume the car continues in the same direction at the same speed, and the wind and river continue to move as stated. 1 hour later, the water-proof glove is (relative to the center of the bridge) approximately\nA. 4km eastward\nB. <1 km northward\nC. >30km away north-westerly\nD. 30 km northward\nE. >30 km away north-easterly.\nF. 5 km+ eastward\n"
