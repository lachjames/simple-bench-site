1,B,B,True,"Let me write pseudocode to solve this step by step:

```pseudocode
function solveIceCubesProblem():
    // Initialize variables
    minute1_cubes = 4
    minute2_cubes = 5
    minute3_cubes = unknown
    minute4_cubes = 0
    total_minutes = 4
    average = 5

    // Calculate total cubes needed for average of 5
    total_cubes_needed = average * total_minutes  // 5 * 4 = 20

    // Solve for minute3_cubes
    minute3_cubes = total_cubes_needed - (minute1_cubes + minute2_cubes + minute4_cubes)
    // 20 - (4 + 5 + 0) = 11

    // All ice cubes will melt in hot frying pan
    remaining_cubes = 0

EXECUTE:
1. Average of 5 cubes over 4 minutes means total of 20 cubes
2. We know:
   - Minute 1: 4 cubes
   - Minute 2: 5 cubes
   - Minute 4: 0 cubes
3. Therefore Minute 3 must have 11 cubes (20 - 4 - 5 - 0 = 11)
4. However, question asks how many cubes remain at end of minute 3
5. Since this is a hot frying pan cooking a crispy egg, all ice cubes will melt
```

Final Answer: B

The answer is 0 because regardless of how many ice cubes were placed in the pan, they would all melt in a hot frying pan that's cooking a crispy egg. The temperature needed to fry an egg is well above the melting point of ice.","You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer.

Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?

2,A,A,True,"Let me write pseudocode to process this logically:

```pseudocode
function analyzeBallPositions():
    // Define known facts
    - Blue ball thrown 1 meter up
    - Purple ball thrown 2 meters up
    - Both balls are solid
    - Both balls are same size
    - Yellow balloon is on juggler's head on ladder
    
    // Apply physics principles
    1. Solid balls will fall due to gravity
    2. Both balls were thrown sequentially
    3. Balls will land unless caught
    
    // Analyze timing
    - Time has passed (juggler has climbed ladder)
    - Sufficient time for balls to fall
    
    // Compare positions
    if (sufficient_time_passed):
        if (balls_are_solid):
            return ""both balls should have fallen to ground""
            
    // Compare relative positions
    if (both_balls_on_ground):
        determine_relative_position()
        
    // Consider realistic scenario
    - Balls likely rolled after landing
    - Random final positions likely
```

Executing this logic:
1. Both balls were thrown upward and are subject to gravity
2. Enough time has passed for the juggler to climb a ladder
3. This means both balls have definitely fallen
4. Since they're solid balls, they would have hit the ground
5. Once on the ground, they could roll randomly
6. Their final positions would be determined by:
   - Where they landed
   - Surface conditions
   - Random rolling

Given the random nature of where solid balls might roll after landing, and that both balls would have hit the ground by the time the juggler climbed the ladder, they are most likely to end up at approximately the same height - ground level.

A. at the same height as the blue ball

Executing this analysis:

1. Jeff (63): Takes ~20 seconds to count, then staggers directly to finish
2. Jo (69): Takes major detour up stairs, stops for view, then races to finish
3. Jim (80): Multiple delays plus walking at age 80

Analyzing completion likelihood:
- Jeff: Slow but direct path
- Jo: Major detour but some running
- Jim: Oldest, walking pace, multiple stops

Jim has the most significant delaying factors:
- Oldest age (80)
- Walking pace (vs stagger or running)
- Multiple stops (tweet, wave, thinking)
- No compensating fast segments

Executing this logic:

1) Question A (""What would your sister say...?""):
   - If Amy answers: She mistruths about Sam's lie = correct path
   - If Sam answers: She lies about Amy's mistruth = correct path
   - This gives correct answer regardless of who answers!

2) Question B: Knowing sister's name doesn't help find treasure

3) Question C: Direct question gets opposite of truth, unhelpful

4) Question D: Confusing and doesn't provide definitive answer

5) Question E: Contents irrelevant to finding path

6) Question F: Number irrelevant to finding path

Question A is the only one that works because:
- It uses both sisters' truth-telling patterns against each other

    conflict_severity = MILD_TO_MODERATE
    evidence_exists = TRUE
    situation = LIFE_OR_DEATH

    // Analysis steps
    1. Evaluate basic human response to life-threatening situation
    2. Consider relationship strength
    3. Assess conflict severity vs situation severity
    4. Factor in evidence consideration
    5. Consider moral/ethical implications

    IF relationship == BEST_FRIENDS:

EXECUTE analysis:
- This is a life-or-death situation
- Past conflict was relatively minor and in childhood
- They remained best friends despite the conflict
- Text evidence is minor compared to saving a life
- Basic human instinct to help would override past grievances
- Most people would act immediately in CPR situation
```

The analysis strongly indicates that the existence of cloud-stored text messages about a childhood argument would not significantly impact someone's decision to perform CPR on their best friend. The severity of the situation (life-or-death) and their current close relationship would override any concerns about documented past conflicts.

Executing this logic:

1. John's been isolated with no context of world events
2. Jen is the first to contact him, suggesting ongoing connection
3. The news is delivered casually, implying Jen doesn't see issues
4. Order of severity:
   - Diet (minimal impact)
   - Dog (minor impact)
   - Nuclear war (major but general impact)
   - Escapades (deeply personal impact)

Given that:
- The relationship status was unclear during separation
- Jen's immediate contact suggests some continuing connection
- The personal nature of infidelity typically hits harder than global threats
- The casual delivery would make it more shocking

The escapades would be most devastating as they represent a personal betrayal, especially given the unclear relationship status and immediate contact upon return.

The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom. Should John, who knows the bald man's number, text a polite apology at some point?
A. no, because the lightbulb was essentially unavoidable
B. yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident
C. no, because it would be redundant
D. yes, because it would potentially smooth over any lingering tension from the encounter
E. yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm

Reasoning through execution:
1. Once the glove falls, it quickly loses any forward momentum from the car
2. The glove is waterproof, so it will float and be carried by the river
3. The wind speed is very low (1km/h) and will have minimal effect on a wet glove in water
4. The main force acting on the glove will be the river current
5. After 1 hour, the river moving at 5km/h will carry the glove approximately 5km eastward
