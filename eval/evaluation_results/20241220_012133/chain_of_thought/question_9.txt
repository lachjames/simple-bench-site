Question ID: 9
Prompt:
You are an expert at reasoning and you always pick the most realistic answer. Think step by step and output your reasoning followed by your final answer using the following format: Final Answer: X where X is one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F.
Agatha makes a stack of 5 cold, fresh single-slice ham sandwiches (with no sauces or condiments) in Room A, then immediately uses duct tape to stick the top surface of the uppermost sandwich to the bottom of her walking stick. She then walks to Room B, with her walking stick, so how many whole sandwiches are there now, in each room?
A. 4 whole sandwiches in room A, 0 whole sandwiches in Room B
B. no sandwiches anywhere
C. 4 whole sandwiches in room B, 1 whole sandwich in Room A
D. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room B
E. 4 whole sandwiches in Room B, 1 whole sandwiches in room A
F. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room A


Model Response:
Let me write pseudocode to process this:

```
function analyzeSandwichProblem():
    // Initial state
    roomA_sandwiches = 5
    roomB_sandwiches = 0
    
    // Process walking stick attachment
    top_sandwich = attach_to_stick()
    remaining_stack = roomA_sandwiches - 1
    
    // Process movement
    if person_walks_to_roomB():
        // What moves with the stick moves to room B
        roomB_sandwiches = 1  // The attached sandwich
        roomA_sandwiches = remaining_stack // The ones left behind
        
    // Check sandwich integrity
    // Since sandwich is cold and fresh with no sauces:
    // - Gravity won't make it fall apart
    // - Duct tape will hold it to stick
    // - Movement won't destroy it
    
    return check_sandwich_counts(roomA_sandwiches, roomB_sandwiches)
```

Executing this logic:
1. Initially 5 sandwiches in Room A
2. One sandwich gets attached to stick
3. 4 sandwiches remain in original stack
4. When Agatha walks to Room B:
   - The stick-attached sandwich goes to Room B
   - The remaining 4 stay in Room A
5. Sandwiches remain whole because:
   - They're cold (won't get mushy)
   - No sauces (won't drip/fall apart)
   - Fresh (won't crumble)
   - Duct tape is strong enough to hold
